            <p>
              Many university students do not get enough sleep during the week.
              As a result, they often feel tired in afternoon classes.
              Recent studies suggest that taking a short nap, usually between
              10 and 20 minutes, can improve attention and memory.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike long naps, which may cause sleepiness and make it harder
              to fall asleep at night, short naps help the brain feel refreshed
              without greatly affecting nighttime sleep.
              Some campuses now provide quiet "nap rooms" so that students can
              rest between classes.
